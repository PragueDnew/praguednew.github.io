## Previous Projects (Undergraduate Period)

**November 2016 - June 2017**

**Experimental and Numerical Simulation of Blood Vessel Flow Based On 3D Printing**

Advisor: [Prof. Jiemin Zhan (SYSU)](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A9%B9%E6%9D%B0%E6%B0%91)        November 2016 - June 2017

•	Designed the physical experiment based on 3D printing model of blood vessel. 

•	Used ANSYS to do numerical simulation of the healthy model and AAA, compare the results with physical experiment.

•	Analysis how blood flow affects the pathology and rupture mechanisms of AAA to help physicians design regimens.


**January - June 2017**

**Diesel Supercharger Snowmobile Rotor Integration**

Advisor: [Prof. Razi Nalim (IUPUI)] (https://et.iupui.edu/people/mnalim)                                   June - August 2016

•	Redesign the rotor fit for the design requirements (includes pressure, comprex, and thermal expansion)

•	Find new material (steel 1010) and new method (jetting) to manufacture the rotor. (cost under 1000 dollars)


**June - August 2016**

**Smart City Surveillance Leveraging Vehicle-Mounted Sensing Capabilities**                    
Advisor: [Prof. Hongbo Liu (IUPUI)](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0vlJjIUAAAAJ&hl=en)    

•	Used Android Studios to design a user application to provide assistance on optimal daily planning for the urban residents. 

•	Designed a sensing application by Android Studios and Java, which can collect data (includes location, wireless signal scanning and collection, live road pictures & videos) from a g-sensor-equipped vehicle and send them to server. 

•	Designed a signal den algorithm and filter to analyze the collected data and live road conditions.


**May 2016 - June 2017**

**Computational fluid dynamics of pore-scale porous media flow** ([Whitney Yu’ Lab](https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu))

•	Segmentate the porous media images and medical CT images (less computational demand and more efficient).

•	Image segmentation based on Level Set method and Lattice Boltzmann method; use an integrated and sustainable software.

**Analysis vessel pressure and blood rate in venal and LVAD project** ([Whitney Yu’ Lab](https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu))

•	Research on four different models (Ascending Aorta, Descending Aorta, Subclavian Artery and Without LVAD)

•	Aim to research the alternative access for implantation other than sternotomy.

•	Change the input or output flow rate, use the Tecplot to gain the different 3D vector field and analyze.
