## Previous Projects

**June 2016 - August 2016**
**Smart City Surveillance Leveraging Vehicle-Mounted Sensing Capabilities**                    
Advisor: [Prof. Hongbo Liu (IUPUI)](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0vlJjIUAAAAJ&hl=en)    

                                                                                                            June - August 2016
•	Used Android Studios to design a user application to provide assistance on optimal daily planning for the urban residents.  
•	Designed a sensing application by Android Studios and Java, which can collect data (includes location, wireless signal scanning and collection, live road pictures & videos) from a g-sensor-equipped vehicle and send them to server. 
•	Designed a signal den algorithm and filter to analyze the collected data and live road conditions.


**May 2016 - June 2017**

**Computational fluid dynamics of pore-scale porous media flow** ([Whitney Yu’ Lab](https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu))

•	Segmentate the porous media images and medical CT images (less computational demand and more efficient).

•	Image segmentation based on Level Set method and Lattice Boltzmann method; use an integrated and sustainable software.

**Analysis vessel pressure and blood rate in venal and LVAD project** ([Whitney Yu’ Lab](https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu))

•	Research on four different models (Ascending Aorta, Descending Aorta, Subclavian Artery and Without LVAD)

•	Aim to research the alternative access for implantation other than sternotomy.

•	Change the input or output flow rate, use the Tecplot to gain the different 3D vector field and analyze. 


**June 2016 - July 2016**

**Training on Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, Siemens Teamcenter** ([Prof. Hazim El-Mounayri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q6rEN2oAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Shuning Li](https://et.iupui.edu/people/li33))

•	Learned Training on Teamcenter document management, product structure management, and workflow management.

**May 2016 - Sept 2016**

**Non-invasive Assessment of Renal Artery Stenosis to Renal Resistance**

Advisor: [Prof. Huidan (Whitney) Yu] (https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu)), [Dr. A. P. Sawchuk](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/alan-sawchuk-326175) (MD, Vascular Surgeon of IU Health)  

•	Conducted 33 cases data analysis which included data calculation, image processing and correlation analysis.

•	Aimed to derive a new renal stenosis resistive index to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of a
clinically-diagnosed renal artery stenosis.
