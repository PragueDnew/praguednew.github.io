## Current Projects
*2018.9-Current* UK DRI Care Research & Technology programme

*2018.9-Current* Systems and Algorithms Laboratory ([SysAL](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/sysal))

## Previous Projects

*May 2016 - June 2017*

**Working in [Whitney Yu’ Lab]**(https://et.iupui.edu/people/whyu)  

1.	Computational fluid dynamics of pore-scale porous media flow

•	Segmentate the porous media images and medical CT images (less computational demand and more efficient).

•	Image segmentation based on Level Set method and Lattice Boltzmann method; use an integrated and sustainable software.

2.	Analysis vessel pressure and blood rate in venal and LVAD project

•	Research on four different models (Ascending Aorta, Descending Aorta, Subclavian Artery and Without LVAD)

•	Aim to research the alternative access for implantation other than sternotomy.

•	Change the input or output flow rate, use the Tecplot to gain the different 3D vector field and analyze. 


*June 2016 - July 2016*

**Training on Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, Siemens Teamcenter** ([Prof. Hazim El-Mounayri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q6rEN2oAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Shuning Li](https://et.iupui.edu/people/li33))

•	Learned Training on Teamcenter document management, product structure management, and workflow management.
